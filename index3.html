                        <p>Skirk, the enigmatic Void Star, resides deep within the Abyss, far
                            from the reach of light and mortal understanding. Detached from
                            the surface world, she chooses solitude to avoid the curses born
                            from bonds and death. Possessing a strength and perception beyond
                            human limits, Skirk speaks only to those she deems her equals,
                            wary of the miscommunication caused by vastly different
                            worldviews. To her, life is a blessing, yet the truths of cosmic
                            forces carry a weight not all are meant to bear. Her existence is
                            a quiet defiance of fate, shaped by knowledge, silence, and the
                            will to remain unseen.</p>
